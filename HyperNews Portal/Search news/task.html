<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>You kept adding news to your site and everything was great. At some point, there was a lot of news materials on your site and it became difficult to find what you need. You decided to add a search to your site.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>Add a search form to your main page with one input element with the name <code class="java">q</code> . The form should send GET requests to the same <em>/news/</em> page. The format of the result page stays the same but includes only that specific piece of news whose title contains the input data.</p>

<p>Do you remember the "<em>Coming soon</em>" page? Now your site is complete and all requests to that page should be redirected to the main page at <em>localhost:8000/news/.</em></p>

<p>Great job!</p>
